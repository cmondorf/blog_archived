This lesson wasn’t added to the end of the lessons already posted, but instead is meant to be seen before the current set of published lessons. In this post I highlight a few key points that struck me as particularly important and noteworthy.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">You’ve learned the syntax, now level up your coding</title><link href="https://cmondorf.github.io/blog/2018/05/28/level-up-coding-skills.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="You’ve learned the syntax, now level up your coding" /><published>2018-05-28T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-05-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://cmondorf.github.io/blog/2018/05/28/level-up-coding-skills</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">So you’ve read a few books, followed a few tutorials, maybe attended a bootcamp. By now you should know the syntax pretty well, but to be able to work comfortably with a language or pass technical interviews you will need to build fluency in it. This is not unlike building virtuosity on a musical instrument, except in this case rather than practicing pieces of music you hack away at coding exercises.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Can artificial intelligence rescue threatened languages?</title><link href="https://cmondorf.github.io/blog/2018/03/14/can-AI-rescue-threatened-languages.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Can artificial intelligence rescue threatened languages?" /><published>2018-03-14T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-03-14T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://cmondorf.github.io/blog/2018/03/14/can-AI-rescue-threatened-languages</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Will AI and machine translation kill off the drive to learn foreign languages, or will it help save them?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Self-driving cars aren’t cars</title><link href="https://cmondorf.github.io/blog/2018/03/08/self-driving-cars-arent-cars.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Self-driving cars aren’t cars" /><published>2018-03-08T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2018-03-08T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://cmondorf.github.io/blog/2018/03/08/self-driving-cars-arent-cars</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">It’s hard to know what self-driving cars will be like, but they won’t be cars. The fact that we can only refer to them as such when discussing them says more about how heavily their legacy weighs on our psyche than it does about them. That’s the point I made in a brief Medium post last year.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">We need to discuss frustration in learning to code</title><link href="https://cmondorf.github.io/blog/2018/03/05/frustration-learning-to-code.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="We need to discuss frustration in learning to code" /><published>2018-03-05T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2018-03-05T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://cmondorf.github.io/blog/2018/03/05/frustration-learning-to-code</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I’ve recently published a post on Medium about a topic I think doesn’t get the attention it deserves: frustration when learning to code.</summary></entry></feed>
